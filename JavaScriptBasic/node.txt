NPM Overview – 5 Key Points:
Default Package Manager:
NPM is the default package manager for Node.js, used to manage JavaScript packages and dependencies.

Command Line Interface (CLI):
It provides a powerful CLI to install, update, and remove packages directly from the terminal.

Online Registry:
NPM connects to a massive online registry (https://www.npmjs.com/) of open-source JavaScript packages.

Dependency Management:
It manages project dependencies through package.json and locks them using package-lock.json.

Local & Global Installation + Publishing:
Supports both local and global package installations, and lets developers create and publish their own packages to the NPM registry.
